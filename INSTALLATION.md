## Troubleshooting

### Script Panel Not Showing

**Solutions:**
1. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
2. Check that the userscript manager is enabled:
   - Click the extension icon
   - Ensure the script is enabled (toggle should be ON)
3. Clear browser cache and reload
4. Check browser console for errors:
   - Press F12
   - Look for error messages in red

### Required Libraries Not Loading
**Problem:** Error messages about missing libraries (bip39, bitcoinjs-lib, etc.)

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Disable any ad-blockers temporarily
3. Allow the script to access CDN resources:
   - In userscript manager settings
   - Enable external script loading

### Balance Check Not Working
**Problem:** Balance check fails or shows error

**Solutions:**

4. Check browser console (F12) for specific error messages

### Copy Buttons Not Working

1. Ensure page is loaded over HTTPS (browsers restrict clipboard on HTTP)
2. Manually select and copy the text:

   - Press Ctrl+C (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+C (Mac)
3. Grant clipboard permissions when prompted

### Script Conflicts
**Problem:** Script doesn't work on certain websites

**Solutions:**

2. Some websites may have strict Content Security Policies
3. Try on a different website
4. Check userscript manager logs for blocked requests

## Advanced Configuration

### Customizing the Panel Position
Edit the CSS in the script to move the panel:

```javascript
// Find this line in the script:
top: 50px;
right: 20px;

// Change to your preferred position, e.g.:
top: 100px;
left: 20px;
```

### Disabling on Specific Sites
In your userscript manager:
1. Click on the script name
2. Go to "Settings" or "Matches"
3. Add exclusions for sites where you don't want it to run
